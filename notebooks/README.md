## PRELIMINAR PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND GUIDELINES
Project Scope: OKCupid Profiles Analysis
Goal:
Uncover insights about dating behavior and user personalities on OKCupid using a mix of exploratory data analysis and machine learning (both structured and text-based data)

Questions to answer from the data:

- Distribution of age ranges in the whole dataset
- Explore all different correlation between variables
- Distribution and proportion of all different sexual orientations
- Relationship between ethnicity and income


Project Ideas:
1) Text Sentiment	Can we infer a user’s attitude (e.g., positive/negative) based on their essay tone?	NLP / Sentiment Analysis

2) Feature Impact	Which features (job, body type, etc.) most strongly influence the likelihood of being single/in a relationship?	Classification + Feature Importance

3) Personality & Behavior	Can we predict someone’s self-described orientation or dating status based on their profile info and writing?	Classification

4) Based on their responses, can we find patterns or predict the zodiac sign?
